Sample Web project:- A hobby project

Technologies Used:- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery 

Functionalies like:-

Display contents when we select item from drop- down menu box.

Autocomplete feature using JQuery autocomplete mechanism. It basically prompts state name of United State automatically when user starts typing into the textbox. For the purpose of this project, states have been hard-coded.

We could have states of United States dynamically coming from the database state table too.

Overall, it was fun project!

JQuery Auto-complete mechanisam is really awesome!
